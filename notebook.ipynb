Continuous Monitoring and Model Updates:

Implement a system for continuous air quality monitoring and model updates. Air quality conditions may change over time due to various factors, and regular updates to the predictive model will ensure its accuracy and reliability.
Integration with Real-Time Sensors:

Explore the integration of real-time air quality sensors to enhance the model's accuracy and provide more timely information to stakeholders. This can improve the responsiveness of health advisories and pollution control measures.
Collaboration with Industry Stakeholders:

Foster collaboration with businesses and industries to encourage the adoption of sustainable practices. Engage in a dialogue with industry stakeholders to promote awareness and develop joint strategies for reducing emissions and pollution.
Public Awareness Campaigns:

Launch public awareness campaigns to educate the general public, especially vulnerable groups, about the health risks associated with air pollution. Empower individuals to take preventive measures during periods of poor air quality.
Multi-Model Approach:

Consider developing and deploying multiple models that specialize in different aspects of air quality. For example, separate models for different pollutants or specific locations within Gucheng. This can provide more granular insights for targeted interventions
